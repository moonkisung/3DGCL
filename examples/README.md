## How to run an .ipynb Jupyter Notebook from terminal?

Some of our implementations in `benchmarks` are in `.ipynb` format so that they can be used as tutorials. 

If you don't want to use the "interactive" feature of Jupyter Notebook, you can also run the `.ipynb` file directly from your terminal as the following example.

```shell script
$ ipython
In [1]: run ./sslgraph/example_graphcl.ipynb
```
